  Extensive data exploration and analysis were conducted on bank loan data for a fictional bank using SQL. Summary reports were developed detailing total loan applications, monthly loan applications, funded amounts, and payments received. Good and bad loan percentages, average interest rates, and debt-to-income ratios were analyzed to assess loan performance. An interactive data visualization dashboard was created on Tableau, showcasing key metrics and trends to enable better decision-making for stakeholders.
